This project is a 2D platformer developed in Unity using C#. It features core mechanics such as double jump, wall climbing, enemy AI, falling platforms, and traps. The goal of the project was to design levels that naturally teach the player mechanics through gameplay rather than direct tutorials.

I focused on teaching mechanics through level design instead of text-based tutorials. For example, early levels demonstrate the use of double jump and wall climbing through safe scenarios before introducing enemies and hazards. This approach helps players learn intuitively while staying immersed.
